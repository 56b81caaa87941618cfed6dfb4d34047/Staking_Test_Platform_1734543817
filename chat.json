It provides input fields for the amount to stake and the nodes to stake on.\n2. It includes buttons to approve TestToken and to stake.\n3. It handles wallet connection and chain checking automatically when interacting with the contract.\n4. It displays status messages and error messages to keep the user informed.\n\nPlease note that this component assumes that the user has TestTokens in their wallet. Also, the nodes input is expected to be a comma-separated list of node identifiers, which will be converted to bytes32 format before being sent to the contract. Make sure to test this component thoroughly in your development environment to ensure it works as expected with your specific setup.\n",
